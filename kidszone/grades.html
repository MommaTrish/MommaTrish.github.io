 <p>Our program tutors all children from grades K-12. We like to motivate our high school young adults to help mentor our younger children and give them a sense of responsibility for others and community. Helping them to see the importance of being there for others.Our program goals focus on specific groups so they can learn and grow within their specific age group. Please see the sections for K-2, 3-6, 7-8, and 9-12 grades. We have wonderful programs that help them live what they learn. Teach them how to apply what they are learning in school to what they do everyday. You and your child/children will be happy with the opportunities we have for them in our KIDS ZONE.<p>
