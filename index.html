  <p> Success is achieved when you have followed all your dreams and taken every step to meet those dreams.
    You have fallen a few times, but you have never given up on your dreams.
    Even if your dream wasn't completed to the standard or way you wanted it, if you gave your all and used ever thing you know how, than you have been sucessful in your journey. If you want to go farther in your dreams, just know you cannot make it by yourself.</p>
